title: Citation File Format (CFF)  
author: Stephan Druskat (mail@sdruskat.net)
abstract: 
  The *Citation File Format* (*CFF*) is a human- *and* machine-readable format 
  for CITATION files. These files provide citation metadata for (research and 
  scientific) software. The format aims to support all use cases for software 
  citation described in {% cite principles %}. CFF is serialized in 
  [YAML](http://yaml.org) [1.2](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html), and is 
  therefore Unicode-based and cross-language (in terms of both natural language 
  scripts and programming languages). This specification, together with the 
  Unicode standard for characters, aims to provide all the information necessary 
  to understand CFF, and to use (i.e., write) and re-use (i.e., read, validate, 
  convert from) it. These specifications are maintained openly at 
  <https://github.com/sdruskat/citation-file-format>.

# Introduction

## Status of this document

This document reflects the version {{ page.version }} of the *Citation File Format* (CFF).
CFF has been developed in the context of the [*Workshop on Sustainable Software
for Science: Practice and Experiences
(WSSSPE5.1)*](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe5-1/), which was held
on 6 September 2017 in Manchester, UK. More specifically, the constraints for
CFF has been developed in the discusion and speed blogging group "Development
and implementation of a standard format for CITATION files", whose members were
Stephan Druskat (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany), Neil Chue Hong
(Software Sustainability Institute, University of Edinburgh, UK), Raniere Silva
(Software Sustainability Institute, University of Manchester, UK), Radovan Bast
(University of Tromsø, Norway), Andrew Rowley (University of Manchester, UK),
and Alexander Konovalov (University of St. Andrews, UK).

CFF Version {{ page.version }} has been developed by Stephan Druskat with contributions from
the following.

- Radovan Bast ([@bast](https://github.com/bast)): Reporter
- Raniere Silva ([@rgaiacs](https://github.com/rgaiacs)): Reporter

CFF has been developed to provide the first iteration of a format for `CITATION`
files which could be recommended to readers of the blog post which has been
produced by the group during the workshop and shortly after, and which will be
published on the [blog page](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog) of the [Software
Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/).

## Rationale

The rationale for a standardized, machine- and human-readable format for
`CITATION` files is discussed in more detail in 
{% cite standardized-citation-files --style ./_bibliography/apa-text.csl %}. CFF has been developed to support all 
use cases for the citation of software, as
discussed in {% cite principles --style ./_bibliography/apa-text.csl %}, and thus promote attribution and credit for
software in general, and research software in particular.
{: .notice--primary}

In a blog post {% cite citation-files %}, Robin Wilson has introduced `CITATION`
files as a means to make citation information for software easily accessible.
This accessibility is important, because in order to receive deserved credit for
research software in the academic system - where credit is still mainly measured
based on citations -, the citation information for software must be made
visible; Authors will only cite software if the citation information is readily
available, as there is no standard, easily deducible way (yet) to cite software,
such as there is for journals for example.

Some have followed the advice, and have uploaded `CITATION` (or `CITATION.md`,
or `CITATION.txt`) files to the root of the source code repository holding their
software. While this practice has made for a good start, plain text,
unstandardized `CITATION` files are not machine-readable, and machine-
readability is a precondition for re-use of the citation information in
different contexts which could further support a fair distribution of credit for
research software.

## Goals
 The goal of CFF is to provide an all-purpose citation format (similar to BibTeX
 or RIS), and specifically provide optimized means of citation for software via
 the provision of software-specific reference keys and types, e.g., a dedicated
 type for source code and one for executables, and a reference key for versions,
 cf. [Reference types](#reference-types).

The ultimate goal of CFF as a project is comprehensive uptake and re-use of the
format by Research Software Engineers and software developers as well as by
vendors and services, such as software repositories, reference managers, etc.,
in order to boost the visibility of citation information for research software,
and empower the fair distribution of credit for software development,
maintenance, etc., in academia.

## Concepts

For users of other reference formats, such as BibTeX or RIS, it is important to
note that in CFF, all available keys can be used for all reference types. CFF
leaves reasonability of use with format users and providers of tooling, such as
conversion software for CFF and other formats. In other words, the use of keys
should follow common sense. If not, it will confuse the user of the `CITATION`
file, and some of the information will probably be lost in re-use scenarios such
as conversion or display. If you feel that CFF does not offer a solution for
your specific use case, please consider contributing to the format as described
in section [Contributions](#contributions).

Furthermore please note that if a section of a work is referenced, this is not
supported by a dedicated reference type. Instead, the `section` key in the parent
type (i.e., `book` for a section of a book, etc.) should be used.

# Format

CFF `CITATION` files must be named `CITATION.cff`.

CFF is implemented in YAML 1.2, as the language provides optimal human-
readability and the required core data types. For details, see the
YAML 1.2 Specifications {% cite yaml-1-2-specs %}.

## File structure

CFF `CITATION` files are YAML 1.2 dictionaries ("maps") with
three mandatory keys: `cff-version`, `message`, `references`.

`cff-version` must specify the exact version of the
Citation File Format that is used for the file.

`message` must specify instructions to users on how
to cite the software the CITATION.cff file is associated
with.

`references` must specify a list of references.

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
cff-version: 1.0.0
message: "Please cite the following works when using this software."
references:
  - ...
  - ...
{% endhighlight %}

### Reference structure

A reference item, i.e., an item in the list under `references`, must at least
specify values for the following mandatory keys: `type`, `authors`, `title`.

`type` must specify the type of the referenced work. For a list of available 
values, cf. [reference types](#reference-types).

`authors` must specify a list of [person objects](#person-objects).

`title` must specify the title of the referenced work.

Additionally, it can contain any further [reference keys](#reference-keys). In version 
{{ page.version }}, 
CFF does not specify a strict schema where specific [reference
types](#reference-types) can only contain specific [reference keys](#reference-keys), although this may be
implemented in future versions.

### Notable reference keys

**conference**, **database‑provider**, **institution**, **publisher**

These keys take an [entity object](#entity-objects) as value. Entity objects
reference named entities and provide a fixed set of keys, such as `name` and
contact information.

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
...
references:
  - type: book
    publisher:
      - name: PeerJ
        city: London
        country: GB
        website: https://peerj.com/
{% endhighlight %}

**authors**, **contact**, **editors**, **editors-series**, **recipients**,
**senders**, **translators**

These keys take a collection of [person objects](#person-objects) as value. Person objects
provide a fixed set of keys to reference individuals, including a detailed
set for specifiying personal names, an affiliation, a role, etc.

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
...
references:
  - type: software
    authors:
      - family-names: Druskat
        given-names: Stephan
        orcid: 0000-0003-4925-7248
        affiliation: "Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin"
        email: "mail@sdruskat.net"
        website: http://sdruskat.net
        role: main-author
      - family-names: Beethoven
        name-particle: van
        given-names: Ludwig
        role: artist
      - family-names: Fernández de Córdoba
        given-names: Gonzalo
        name-suffix: Jr.
        role: tester
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

**type**, **languages**, **programming-languages**, **status**

These keys only take values from a defined set, cf. the respective sections:

- [Reference types](#reference-types)
- [Language strings](#language-strings)
- [Programming language strings](#programming-language-strings)
- [Status strings](#status-strings)

**license‑url**, **repository**, **repository-code**, **repository-artifact**,
**url**

These keys take URL strings as values.

**keywords**

This key takes a collection of strings.

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
...
references:
  - type: software
    keywords:
      - linguistics
      - "multi-layer annotation"
      - web service
    ...
{% endhighlight %}


**scope**

A reference item can specify a more detailed scope for the reference, via the 
reference key `scope`. This key can be useful if certatin references should only
be cited under specific circumstances, e.g., only when a specific package
of the software is used. In such a case, the package would ideally have its own
CFF file, but if this is not possible for whatever reason, the `scope` key
my come in handy.

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
...
references:
  - scope: "Cite this paper when you run software X with flag --xy"
    type: article
    ...
{% endhighlight %}




## Formatting

CFF follows the formatting rules of YAML 1.2, of which one of
the most important ones is that the colon (`:`) after a key should always be
followed by a whitespace. 

Structure is determined by indentation, i.e., lines
containing nested elements must be indented by at least one whitespace character,
although using at least two whitespaces as a standard for indentation preserves 
readability.

Value strings can (and sometimes should) be double-quoted, e.g. `"string"`, 
especially when they contain YAML special characters, or special characters in
general. These include: 

> `:  {  }  [  ]  ,  &  *  #  ?  |  -  <  >  =  !  %  @  \`

## Reference keys

CFF defines the following reference keys.

# Objects

## Entity objects

Entity objects can represent different types of entities, e.g., 
a publishing company, or conference. In CFF, they are realized as collections with
a defined set of keys. Only the key `name` is mandatory. 

| Entity key   | Entity Data Type | optional |
| -            | -                | :-:      |
| `name`       | String           |          |
| `address`    | String           | •        |
| `city`       | String           | •        |
| `region`     | String           | •        |
| `post-code`  | String           | •        |
| `country`    | String           | •        |
| `orcid`      | String           | •        |
| `email`      | String           | •        |
| `tel`        | String           | •        |

### Exemplary uses

**address**

- To be used for street names and house numbers, etc.

**region**

- To be used for, e.g., states (as in US states or German federal states).

**post-code**

- The post code or zip code of an address.

**country**

- The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for a country. A list of ISO 3166-1 
alpha-2 codes can be found at
[Wikipedia:ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).

Example:

**date-start** and **date-end**

- The start and end date of, e.g., a conference. This must be formatted 
according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), e.g., 
`YYYY-MM-DD`, or `2017-10-04T16:20:57+00:00`.

## Person objects

A person object represents a person. In CFF, person objects are realized as
collections with a defined set of keys, of which only `family-names` and
`given-names` are mandatory.

### Exemplary uses

**Name keys**

CFF aims at implementing a culturally neutral model for personal names, 
according to the
[suggestions on splitting personal names by the W3C](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names) 
and the implementation of personal name splitting in 
BibTeX {% cite names-in-bibtex %}.

To this end, CFF provides four generic keys to specify personal names: 


1. Values for `family-names` specify family names, including combinations of given and 
patronymic forms, such as *Guðmundsdóttir* or *bin Osman*; double names with or 
without hyphen, such as *Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger* or *Sánchez Vicario*. It 
can potentially also specify names that include prepositions or (nobiliary)
particles, especially if they occur in between family names such as in Spanish-
or Portuguese-origin names, such as *Fernández de Córdoba*.
2. Values for `given-names` specify given and any other names.
3. Values for `name-particle` specify nobiliary particles and prepositions, such as in
Ludwig *van* Beethoven or Rafael *van der* Vaart.
4. Values for `name-suffix` specify suffixes such as *Jr.* or *III* (as in 
[Frank Edwin Wright *III*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%A9_Cool)).

Note that these keys may still not be optimal for, e.g., Icelandic names which
do not have the concept of family names, or Chinese generation names, but the 
alternative is highly localized customization, which would be counterintuitive 
as to CFF's goal to be easily accessible. Thus, it is ultimately the task of CFF 
file authors to find the optimal name split in any given case.

**affiliation**

- To specify the affiliation of a person, e.g., a university, research centre, etc.

**Address keys**

- Cf. [Entity objects](#entity-objects) for details.

**orcid**

- To specify an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) identifier in the format
`dddd-dddd-dddd-dddd`, e.g., `0000-0003-4925-7248`.

### Person roles

A person object can be assigned a role for the purposes of
specifying authorship status, e.g., to distinguish main authors of a software
from contributors who have provided a small patch. The defined roles are:


|                                      Key                                      |

# Specified value strings

The keys `status`, `languages` and `programming-languages` can only take values
from a fixed set of strings. These are specified below.

## Status strings

Works can have a different status of publication, e.g., journal papers. CFF
specifies the following value strings for the key `status`.

  | Status (String)  |                                     Description                                      |

## Language strings

Natural languages as a value for the key `languages` are specified via their
respective 3-character [ISO 639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3) code. A list
of ISO 639-3 codes in maintained at 
[Wikipedia:List of ISO 639-3 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes).
Alternatively, a language's 2-character 
[ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code may be used. A list
of ISO 639-1 codes is maintained at
[Wikipedia:List of ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

Example for a work in both English and Daakaka:

{% highlight yaml %}
...
references:
  - type: book
    ...
    languages:
      - en
      - bpa
{% endhighlight %}

## Programming language strings

CFF specifies the following value strings for the key `programming-languages`.
If a language is not included, please use the string `other` with a lower-case,
hyphenated string argument, and do not include the version of the programming
language used, e.g., for *My Fancy Language v4.2.1*, use `other=my-fancy-
language`. Additionally, please create an issue on the [GitHub repository for
CFF](https://github.com/sdruskat/citation-file-format/issues/new), asking to
include the programming language in the list.

  Table: List of programming language names available in CFF. Table based on the languages available on GitHub (via <https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml>, MIT license, Copyright (c) 2017 GitHub, Inc.).

# Schema

Work is still in progress to provide a schema for CFF, against which CFF files
can be validated.

# Examples

## Software examples

One of the main foci of CFF is to comprehensively cover the provision of 
citation metadata for software. To this end, it should always be used based on
the Software Citation Principles {% cite principles %}! Please make sure you
follow the best practices wherever possible. Two typical scenarios for
software citation metadata include the existence and respectively lack of a
DOI for the software for which citation metadata is provided, for both of which 
examples follow.

### A software with a DOI

Note that {% cite principles -l 12 %} recommends

> [...] the use of DOIs as the unique identifier due to their common usage and
acceptance, particularly as they are the standard for other digital products
such as publications.

Furthermore, DOIs should point to a "unique, specific software version" 
{% cite principles -l 12 %}. Also it is recommended {% cite principles -l 13 %} that:

> the [DOI] should resolve to a persistent landing page that contains metadata 
and a link to the software itself, rather than directly to the source code files,
repository, or executable.

Therefore, a minimal `CITATION.cff` file in such a case would look similar to
the following.

{% highlight yaml %}
cff-version: 1.0.0
message: If you use this software, please cite it as below.
references:
  - type: software
    authors:
      - family-names: Druskat
        given-names: Stephan
        orcid: 0000-0003-4925-7248
    title: My Research Tool
    version: 1.0.4
    doi: 10043/zenodo.1234
{% endhighlight %}

A more comprehensive version could look similar to the following.

{% highlight yaml %}
cff-version: 1.0.0
message: If you use this software, please cite it as below.
references:
  - type: software
    authors:
      - family-names: Druskat
        given-names: Stephan
        orcid: 0000-0003-4925-7248
        affiliation: "Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Dept. of German Studies 
        and Linguistics"
        email: mail@sdruskat.net
        website: https://hu.berlin/sdruskat
    title: My Research Tool
    version: 1.0.4
    doi: 10043/zenodo.1234
    repository-code: https://github.com/sdruskat/my-research-tool
    repository-artifact: https://hu.berlin/nexus/mrt

    keywords:

      - parser

    programming-languages:
      - java
      - python
      - c
      - haskell
      - pascal
      - rust

    license-url: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
    url: https://sdruskat.github.io/my-research-tool
{% endhighlight %}

### A software without a DOI

For software without a DOI, it is recommended that "the metadata should still
provide information on how to access the specific software, but this may be a
company’s product number or a link to a website that allows the software be
purchased." {% cite principles -l 13 %}. Furthermore, "if the version number and
release date are not available, the download date can be used. Similarly, the
contact name/email is an alternative to the location/repository." 
{% cite principles -l 7 %}

Hence, for a closed source software without a DOI for which the version number
and release date cannot be determined, a `CITATION.cff` file could look like
this.

{% highlight yaml %}
cff-version: 1.0.0
message: "If you dare to use this commercial, closed-source, unversioned software 
in your research, please at least cite it as below."
references:
  - type: software
    title: Opaquity

### `software` (with two references)

{% highlight yaml %}
cff-version: 1.0.0
message: "If you use My Research Tool, please cite both the software and the 
outline paper."

    doi: 10.9999/hardscifi-lang.42132
{% endhighlight %}

### `software-code` (without a DOI: code repository + commit)

> We recognize that there are certain situations where it may not be possible to
follow the recommended best-practice. For example, if (1) the software authors
did not register a DOI and/or release a specific version, or (2) the version of
the software used does not match what is available to cite. In those cases,
falling back on a combination of the repository URL and version number/commit
hash would be an appropriate way to cite the software used. {% cite principles -l 12 %}
